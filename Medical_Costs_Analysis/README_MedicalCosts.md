This analysis was made using the Medical Cost Personal Dataset, available on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

The motivation is to analyze the variables and the relation with the charges of each people, getting important insights.

Dataset Columns:

- age: age of primary beneficiary
- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- smoker: Smoking
- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance


This can be important to alert people about smoking for example.

Questions I will try to answer:

- Is there a big difference between the charges of smokers and no smokers?

- Is there some difference of the charge for people who has children?

- Quantity of smokers by age

- If the number of children impact on the charges

I will plot some graphics to better visualization
