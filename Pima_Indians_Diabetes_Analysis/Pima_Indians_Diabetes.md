# **Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis**


This analysis was conducted using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a well-known dataset available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mragpavank/diabetes/data). The dataset consists of medical data collected from women of Pima Indian heritage, who have a high prevalence of diabetes. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on various health metrics, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI.

The motivation for this analysis is to explore how medical data can be used to identify individuals at risk for diabetes, potentially enabling earlier interventions and better management of the disease.


# **Data Exploration**
During the data exploration phase, I focused on understanding the dataset's structure and performing preliminary analyses. This included visualizations of important features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. I also examined correlations between features to identify the relationships that might be significant in predicting diabetes risk.

# **Data Preprocessing**
The dataset contained some missing values, which were handled using imputation techniques. I also scaled the features using the StandardScaler to standardize the values before feeding them into the machine learning models. This step was crucial for the model's performance, as features with different ranges could affect the model's convergence.

# **Model Selection**
For this project, I used Logistic Regression, which is suitable for binary classification tasks like diabetes prediction (diabetic vs. non-diabetic).

# **Model Evaluation**
After training the model on the training set, I evaluated its performance using accuracy. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of the model in identifying individuals with diabetes.

# **Conclusion**
This analysis demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

# **Insights and Future Work**

- The most important features influencing the modelâ€™s predictions include glucose levels and BMI.

- The model is a good starting point but can be enhanced with additional techniques such as feature engineering or ensemble models.

- Future work could focus on collecting more data to improve model generalization and testing it on real-world cases.
