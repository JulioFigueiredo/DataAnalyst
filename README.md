# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases three of my data analysis projects where I applied various tools, techniques, and methodologies to draw insights from data. Below is an overview of each project.

## Projects

### 1. Project 1: IBM_HumanResources_Analysis

**Description:** The motivation is to understand the profile of the people who leave the company. This can be important to prevent layoffs, reduce operational costs and improve employee satisfaction, which, consequently, should increase the company's productivity.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 2. Project 2: Medical_Costs_Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I analyzed the variables and the relation with the charges of each people, this can be important to alert people about smoking for example.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

**Key Insights:**  

- It is possible to see that the smokers has more charges than no smokers, Maybe the smokers has more health problems than no smokers.

- It is possible to see that people who do have children have more charges than people who do not have children


### 3. Project 3: CristianoRonaldo_AllClubGoals_Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I analyzed all Cristiano Ronaldo goals for clubs in his career. The motivation is to analyze the variables about all the goals and the performance of Cristiano Ronaldo during his career.
This can be important for football lovers to have a new vision of CR7 career 

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

**Key Insights:**  

- Ronaldo's top scoring season was 14/15 with 61 goals
  
- Ronaldo has 140 goals in UEFA Champions League

- Ronaldo has 17 goals on the minute 90.

## About Me

I am passionate about data analysis and enjoy applying my skills to real-world problems. My expertise includes Python, SQL, Power BI, and statistical methods for data exploration and visualization.

### 4. Project 4: Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various medical factors such as age, glucose levels, and insulin. Itâ€™s important for understanding health patterns and potentially preventing diabetes in at-risk populations.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Insights:**  

- Glucose levels and age are the most significant predictors of diabetes.

- The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 75%, with a recall value indicating some room for improvement in detecting true positive cases.
